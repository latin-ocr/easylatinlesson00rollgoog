His book is intended to furnish enough material for all the

work in Latin Composition in the secoodary school. The
author‘s convictionis that the primary tirnction of latin Compo-
sition in high schools is to extend and strengthen the pupil's
knowledge of latin Grammar. The principles ol syntax are ar·
ranged in the systematic order os the grammms and are illustrated
by disoonnected sentences.

Each lesson contains first grammatical principles, with reler-
encee to the standard grammars. These are followed by simple
illustrative sentences, a vocabulary‚ and then by well-graded sen·
tences to he put into Latin. No effort has been spared to make
the sentences as attractive as possible. ’ .

The hook is arranged iu three parts, as follows : -

Part 1 contains thirty lessons‚ using the vombulary and con·
structions ol Caesar. The model sentences are taken from Caesar
and labelled with the point which each illustratos. There are fif-
teen exercises in connected composition scattered through the
lessons. Two systematic general reviews are firmished.

Part 11 has the same plan, but is based on Cicero. The model
sentences are taken from Cicero.

Part 111 contains exercises in connected discourse, with foot-
notes referring to the grammatical points illustrated. There are
specimen examinatior papers and a complete vocabulary.
